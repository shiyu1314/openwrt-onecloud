/* This header file does not have include-guards as it is meant to be
   includable multiple times as long as the necessary defines have
   been set up.

   A stack is implemented with a homogenous array of elements in
   memory, which will be resized (and moved) as needed.  Elements are
   passed by value and it is the responsibility of the user-code to
   free any resources associated with individual elements.

   The exported names are all prefixed by ‘stack’ (e.g. stack_init),
   but this can be changed by setting an appropriate define.
     Type:               stack_type
     Initialization:     stack_init (&stack);
     De-initialization:  stack_destroy (&stack);
     Predicate:          bool res = stack_empty (&stack);
     Introspection:      ELEMENT *base = stack_base (&stack);
     Pushing:            stack_push (&stack, element);
     Popping:            ELEMENT element = stack_pop (&stack);
     Discarding:         stack_discard (&stack);
     Top-of-stack:       ELEMENT element = stack_top (&stack);
     Size:               idx_t size = stack_size (&stack);

   Here, ELEMENT is the type to which GL_STACK_ELEMENT was defined when
   this file was included.

/* Before including this file, you need to define:
     GL_STACK_ELEMENT       The type of the elements on the stack.
     GL_STACK_STORAGECLASS  (Optional) The storage class specifier (e.g. static)
                            to use in the function definitions.
     GL_STACK_NAME          (Optional) The prefix to use for the type names
                            and functions definitions instead of the default
                            ‘stack’.

   After including this file, these names will be undefined.

   Before including this file, you also need to include:
     #include <stdlib.h>
