/* This file provide a facility to allocate and free immutable data objects.

   An immutable data object is allocated in three steps:
     1. You allocate an immutable memory region.
          DATA *wp = immmalloc (sizeof (*wp));
        The pointer wp is actually a writable view to the memory region.
     2. You fill the memory region, through the pointer wp:
          wp->x = ...;
          wp->y = ...;
          ...
     3. You declare the memory region as frozen.  This means that you relinquish
        write access.
          DATA const *p = immfreeze (wp);
        You can now let wp get out-of-scope.

   Then the pointer p can be used only in read-only ways.  That is, if you cast
   away the 'const' and attempt to write to the memory region, it will crash at
   runtime (through a SIGSEGV signal).
     p->x = ...;             // rejected by the compiler
     ((DATA *) p)->x = ...;  // crashes at runtime

   Finally, you can free the immutable data object:
     immfree (p);

/* If you compile this module with the C macro NO_IMMUTABLE set to 1, or on a
   platform that lacks support for read-only and writeable memory areas, the
