/* This module provides a persistent version of hash array mapped
   tries (hamts) that can be used in place of hash tables when pure
   (functional) operations are needed.

   A hash function and an equivalence predicate has to be provided for
   the elements that can be inserted, replaced and removed in a hamt.
   A hamt cannot contain duplicates that compare equal.

   Each non-destructive updating operation returns a new hamt, which
   shares structure with the original one.  Destructive updates only
   effect the hamt, on which the destructive operation is applied.
   For example, given a hamt HAMT1, any non-destructive update
   operation (e.g. hamt_insert) will result in a new hamt HAMT2.
   Whatever further operations (destructive or not, including freeing
   a hamt) are applied to HAMT1 won't change HAMT2 and vice versa.  To
   free all the memory, hash_free has therefore to be applied to both
   HAMT1 and HAMT2.

   If persistence is not needed, transient hash tables are probably
   faster.
