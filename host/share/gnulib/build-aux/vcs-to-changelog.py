''' Generate a ChangeLog style output based on a VCS log.

This script takes two revisions as input and generates a ChangeLog style output
for all revisions between the two revisions.

This script is intended to be executed from the project parent directory.

The vcstocl directory has a file vcstocl_quirks.py that defines a
function called get_project_quirks that returns a object of class type
ProjectQuirks or a subclass of the same.  The definition of the ProjectQuirks
class is below and it specifies the properties that the project must set to
ensure correct parsing of its contents.

Among other things, ProjectQurks specifies the VCS to read from; the default is
assumed to be git.  The script then studies the VCS log and for each change,
list out the nature of changes in the constituent files.

Each file type may have parser frontends that can read files and construct
objects that may be compared to determine the minimal changes that occured in
each revision.  For files that do not have parsers, we may only know the nature
of changes at the top level depending on the information that the VCS stores.

The parser frontend must have a compare() method that takes the old and new
files as arrays of strings and prints the output in ChangeLog format.

Currently implemented VCS:

    git

Currently implemented frontends:

    C
