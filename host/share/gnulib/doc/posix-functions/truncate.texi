Gnulib module: truncate

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.4 with @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} in effect.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, this function is not
applicable to arbitrary lengths for files larger than 2 GB@.  The fix is to
use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
@item
This function does not fail when the file name argument ends in a slash
and (without the slash) names a non-directory, on some platforms:
AIX 7.2.
