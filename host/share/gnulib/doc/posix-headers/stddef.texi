Gnulib module: stddef

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms fail to provide @code{unreachable}, which was added in C23:
GCC 13, clang 15, AIX with xlc 12.1, Solaris with Sun C 5.15, and others.

@item
Some platforms fail to provide @code{max_align_t}, which was added in C11:
NetBSD 8.0, Solaris 11.0, and others.

@item
@code{max_align_t} does not have the expected alignment on some platforms:
NetBSD 8.0/x86, AIX 7.2 with xlc in 64-bit mode.

@item
Some old platforms fail to provide @code{wchar_t}.

@item
Some platforms provide a @code{NULL} macro that cannot be used in arbitrary
expressions:
NetBSD 5.0

@item
Some platforms provide a @code{NULL} macro whose value does not have the size
of a pointer:
AIX 7.2 with xlc in 64-bit mode.

@item
When this header file is provided by TinyCC 0.9.27 on glibc or macOS systems,
it does not fulfil the expectations of other system header files.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
@cindex null pointer type
Some platforms fail to provide @code{nullptr_t},
which Gnulib cannot usefully emulate:
GCC 12, Clang 15, and other pre-2023 C compilers.

@item
Some platforms provide an @code{offsetof} macro that cannot be used in
arbitrary expressions:
Solaris 11.4
This problem can be worked around by parenthesizing the
@code{offsetof} expression in the unlikely case you use it with
@code{sizeof} or @samp{[]}.
