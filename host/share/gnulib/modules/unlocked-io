AC_DEFINE([GNULIB_STDIO_SINGLE_THREAD], [1],
  [Define to 1 if you want the FILE stream functions getc, putc, etc.
   to use unlocked I/O if available, throughout the package.
   Unlocked I/O can improve performance, sometimes dramatically.
   But unlocked I/O is safe only in single-threaded programs,
   as well as in multithreaded programs for which you can guarantee that
   every FILE stream, including stdin, stdout, stderr, is used only
   in a single thread.])

AC_DEFINE([USE_UNLOCKED_IO], [GNULIB_STDIO_SINGLE_THREAD],
  [An alias of GNULIB_STDIO_SINGLE_THREAD.])
