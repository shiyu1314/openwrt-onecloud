This directory contains license notices, ready for copy-and-pasting into
Gnulib source files.

The wording is based on the Maintainers Guide, section "License Notices",
<https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices.html>.

Instead of "this program", we write "this file", because Gnulib files
are very often copied into other packages, and we want to avoid the
impression that the entire package is under a weaker license than it
actually is.

The difference between 'unlimited' and 'public domain' is that 'unlimited'
still requires the license notice to be preserved, while 'public domain'
does not.
